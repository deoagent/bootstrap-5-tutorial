Bugs and feature requests
Have a bug or a feature request? Please first read the issue guidelines and search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, please open a new issue.

Documentation
Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with Hugo and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at https://getbootstrap.com/. The docs may also be run locally.

Documentation search is powered by Algolia's DocSearch. Working on our search? Be sure to set debug: true in site/assets/js/search.js.

Running documentation locally
Run npm install to install the Node.js dependencies, including Hugo (the site builder).
Run npm run test (or a specific npm script) to rebuild distributed CSS and JavaScript files, as well as our docs assets.
From the root /bootstrap directory, run npm run docs-serve in the command line.
Open http://localhost:9001/ in your browser, and voil√†.
Learn more about using Hugo by reading its documentation.

Versioning
For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap is maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines. Sometimes we screw up, but we adhere to those rules whenever possible.
